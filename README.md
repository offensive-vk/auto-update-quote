Action that allows you to add and update a random quote or fact on your README or Docs.

## Random Quote/Fact on your (Profile) Readme

### Prepare Your Repository

1. You need to update the markdown file(.md) with 2 comments. You can refer to [here](#update-your-readme) for updating it.
2. **Optional** You'll need a GitHub API Token with `repo` scope from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) if you're running the action for a non-profile repository.
   - You can use [this](#other-repository-not-profile) example to work it out.
3. You can follow any one example below according to your needs to get started!
   - Use [this](#profile-repository) on Profile Repository.
   - Use [this](#other-repository-not-profile) on any other Repository.
4. It is better to run the Action on your Profile Repository since you won't be needing a GitHub Access Token!
5. Check [this](#examples) to see available options while creating a workflow for this action.

For GitHub token permissions you can refer [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

### Update Your Readme

Add a comment to your `README.md` like this:

```md
<!--STARTS_HERE_QUOTE_README-->
<i>❝As computers run, they get hot. Computers have fans to keep them cool.❞</i>
<!--ENDS_HERE_QUOTE_README-->
```

5. Go to Workflows menu (mentioned in step 1), click `Update Quote Readme`, click `Run workflow`.
6. Go to your profile page, you will be able to see a random quote/fact wherever you placed [this](#update-your-readme) comment on README.

### Examples

1. If you want to use this action for a README that is not present in current workflow repository.

```yml
- uses: offensive-vk/auto-update-quote@v5
  with:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}     # Needed if README repository is not profile repo
    REPOSITORY: <username>/<differentrepo>
```

Using `REPOSITORY` will change README present in that repository head.

For example, if your workflow is present in `<username>/repo1` and you want to update README present in `<username>/repo2`, then assign `REPOSITORY` to `<username>/repo2` in workflow at `<username>/repo1`.

2. You can specify a commit message to override the default _"Update with auto-update-quote"_.

```yml
- uses: offensive-vk/auto-update-quote@v5
  with:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}     # Needed if README repository is not profile repo
    REPOSITORY: <username>/<differentrepo>  # Needed if README repository is not current repo
    COMMIT_MESSAGE: <your-commit-message>       # default - Update with auto-update-quote
```

3. You can also choose if you only want either a random `quote` or a random `funfact` to appear on your readme, by default it is `both`.

```yml
- uses: offensive-vk/auto-update-quote@v5
  with:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}     # Needed if README repository is not profile repo
    REPOSITORY: <username>/<differentrepo>  # Needed if README repository is not current repo
    COMMIT_MESSAGE: <your-commit-message>       # default - Update with auto-update-quote
    OPTION: both            # default - both, can be one of (quote, funfact, both), if 'both' then will display either a quote or a fact
```
